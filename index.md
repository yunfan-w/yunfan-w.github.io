## About Me

Hello! I'm Yunfan Wang, a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/computer-science) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), starting in Fall 2024. 

Before joining the University of Virginia, I earned a __Bachelor of Engineering__ in Computer Science and Technology and a __Bachelor of Economics__ in Economics from [Xi’an Jiaotong University](https://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021. I completed my __Master of Engineering__ in Computer Science and Technology at the same university in 2024, under the guidance of Professor [Qinghua Zheng](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/qhzheng).

## Research Interests
My research interests lie broadly in Machine Learning and its applications, including:
- Large Language Models: Understanding, enhancing, and applying LLMs in complex and real-world scenarios
- Graph Learning and Mining: Representation learning, anomaly detection, and structured reasoning
- ML Systems: Scalable and efficient infrastructure to support machine learning model development and deployment
- Interpretable and Robust ML: Making machine learning more understandable, reliable, and aligned with human expectations

## News

- **[Jun. 2025]** I received a travel grant to attend OSDI 2025! Grateful for the generous support.
- **[Aug. 2024]** Started my Ph.D. journey at the University of Virginia.
